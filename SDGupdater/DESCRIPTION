Description: Functions used by the ONS UK SDG data team to transform data
		from various sources into the format required for updating the UK SDG data
		website (www.sdgdata.gov.uk). Data come in a wide range of formats, often
		with complex headings, or multiple tables per sheet. These functions are used
		to tidy the data, and for commonly used calculations such as calculating a
		rate per 1000 population when the numerator is greater than x.
